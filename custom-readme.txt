- strict mode of react 18 start an "duplicates keys components error" (i dont know why). So i just comment the stric mode.
- other way to resolve "duplicates keys components error" is not concating the LoadedPosts with the current state.posts and just set the state.posts = loadedPosts (that way can keep the stric mode of react 18)
